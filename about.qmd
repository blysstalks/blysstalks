### Matthias

My name is Matthias, and in daily life, I organize events and advocate for better working conditions for employees in and around Chemnitz. I want to create an environment around me where people from all walks of life enjoy living, working, and engaging with others.

I have traveled extensively (e.g., to Berlin, Frankfurt, Dresden, Hamburg, and Munich) to gain experience for this goal. In the meantime, I believe that discussing relevant topics is the best way to connect with people and achieve shared goals.

Being part of this podcast is, therefore, very important to me.
